# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection

Although digital transactions in India registered a 51% growth in 2018â€“2019, their safety remains a concern. Fraudulent activities have increased severalfold, with approximately 52,304 cases of credit/debit card fraud reported in FY 2019 alone. Owing to this steep increase in banking frauds, it is the need of the hour to detect these fraudulent transactions in time to help consumers and banks that are losing their credit worth each day. Machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions.
This project is all about building a model which can detect fraud transactions.
